# Calculator-Js-Html-Css
Welcome, this is my calculator. To make it i used HTML to build the structure of the calculator and CSS to style and design it. Then, I used Javascript to add functionality to the calculator buttons so that it could perform mathematical operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
